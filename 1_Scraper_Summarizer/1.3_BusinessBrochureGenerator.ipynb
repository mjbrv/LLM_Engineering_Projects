      "Blueprint built the infrastructure that allowed us to make real-time decisions about the value our marketing efforts were driving and the results we were seeing. It started with building out the analytics to feed a dashboard to show cross-channel impressions, click-throughs across social channels, emails, direct mail, mobile, etc. As time went on, we introduced new channels and created more in-depth dashboards. It’s one thing to see the effectiveness of our marketing campaign, but what was even more important was why. Why did one email perform so much better than another? Why, when partnered with direct mail, did that email do even better? Blueprint provided analysis that helped further optimize, test and learn.\n",
