## Future Directions:
- One markdown file for showing each news independently. Each news can have its original title, source name and link, key points, sentiment score, bias score, credebility or fact check? score etc.

- One markdown file for showing overal report (like the current version)

### Note: 
- Actually it's a good way of staying on top of news  in any topics, or with any key words
- can be good hints for investment strategy (both personal and in app)
